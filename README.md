Internship project

How to (very briefly):
  Configure Maven and Tomcat in your Eclipse installation
  Fork this repository to your github account and freely edit it (There's a fork link above, next to Watch and Star)
  Clone the repository in your desktop
  Make sure xml files are configured properly, it's the most likely reason why this won't work in the first try
  
The Data Access layer is tested and functional, any new functionalities can be easily added by writing your own methods in the DAO classes.

Some DTO classes still need some work done on them.

The services (Controllers) have not been fully tested due to time constraints and are most likely not working as expected.

We didn't have any time to fix the Solver class which was done by our colleagues from May and we have no idea what it does.

Good luck!
